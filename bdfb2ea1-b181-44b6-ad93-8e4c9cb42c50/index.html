several years now Enrico Fink has been one of the major figures in
the Jewish music and theatre scene in Italy, regularly touring Europe
and the US with different groups and projects – and invited to hold
speeches, seminars and lectures from universities, music schools,
Jewish museums and institutions the world over. </p><p>Enrico was
born in Florence, the great-grandson of a Jewish-Russian refugee who
served as cantor in many Italian synagogues.  After a variety of
musical experiences in groups ranging from funk-rock to contemporary
music (with pauses to complete a degree in physics) he has devoted
himself to new interpretations of the Jewish cultural tradition,
finding a path between "radical" and traditional, which
uses both music and musical theater as means of expression. He
frequently appears in major venues throughout Europe, and with
Ensemble Lucidarium is going to have his fifth US tour in February
2015, a tour which will include a presentation of his “Shirat
hayam” project in New York, with the participation of Frank London.

</p><p>He
has created a number of theatrical productions, including "Yonah,"
"Purimspil" and "Lokshen," and performing in many
 national productions (also starring as Motl in Italy’s blockbuster
production of  “Fiddler on the Roof”).  As a lecturer, he has
held yearly classes as Professor of History of Jewish Music at the
Jewish Studies University in Rome, at the Florence Bet haMidrash, at
the Scuola di Alto Perfezionamento Musicale di Bertinoro, at the
Circolo Gianni Bosio in Rome: and has been an invited lecturer in US
universities (Yale, Stanford, Syracuse, UC in Santa Cruz, UW in
Madison...), as well as in Jewish institutions and schools throughout
Italy, Europe and the US. As actor and musician he has performed just
about everywhere, from international pop festivals to classical
concert houses, from jazz clubs to discos, from sidewalks to the most
famous theater houses. And besides native Italy, where he performs
regularly, he has appeared in venues such as the Ashkenaz Festival in
Toronto, the Festival
De Musique Sacree de Perpignan, the Mozartsaal at the Wien
Konzerthaus, the San Francisco Jewish Music Festival, the TribOz club
and the Sala Verdi in Rio de Janeiro, the Netwerk Oude Muziek
Holland, the York Early Music Festival, the Budapest Jewish Music
Festival, the Music Biennale Zagreb, the Seattle Early Music
Festival, and in an impressive number of venues  throughout Croatia,
Poland, Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, Austria, France, Holland,
England, Brazil. </p><p>Enrico's
first works have mainly focused on klezmer and east european Jewish
tradition, both secular and religious; but he has been working for a
long time on an Italian repertoire, vast and in some respects
unexplored. Already in his first play and CD, Lokshen-Patrilineare
(1999), his paternal family's long voyage from Russia to Italy at the
start of the century was told in music, bringing together East
European hazanut and some melodies of Italian liturgical tradition;
much research has followed, especially in Ferrara and Firenze Jewish
communities, listening not only to the melodies still in use (and
which Enrico often sings in the synagogue), but also to
long-forgotten music, thanks to sheet music and recordings belonging
to families and public institutions. In 2005 he has published his
second CD The Jazz Singer’s Return to Faith for one of Italy’s
oldest and best-known indie companies, Materiali Sonori – an album
devoted to a very personal and creative rendition of Jewish Italian
religious music; and together with Lucidarium, one of Europe’s
leading early music ensembles, he has explored the Renaissance roots
of this material, publishing La Istoria de Purim in 2006 for the
French label k617. He is since 2006 the director of the "Orchestra
Multietnica di Arezzo", a 30-some element band made up of
musicians of many different origins and cultures: the "O.M.A."
has produced two CDs, and was awarded the "Suoni di Confine"
prize for its 2009-2010 live exhibitions by Italy's  Independent
Music Meeting in Faenza. Its second CD was "Album of the week"
for the national public radio Channel 3.</p><p><i>Essential
